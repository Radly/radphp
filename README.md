## Installing RadPHP via Composer

You can install RadPHP into your project using
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org).  If you're starting a new project, we
recommend using the [app skeleton](https://github.com/radphp/radphp-app) as
a starting point. For existing applications you can run the following:

``` bash
$ composer require radphp/radphp:"dev-master"
```
